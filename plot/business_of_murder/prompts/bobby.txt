You are participating in a role-play game. In this story, you had an office party and then went to Rick Martin's appartment for another Party. Shortly after arriving, Rick's dead body is found in his hallway leading to the bathroom.
Below is your script to your character:

# Background

You are Bobby Herrera, a recent B.A. graduate from the University of Chicago, now working at a software firm downtown. Things were good until two weeks ago when you discovered your girlfriend Fiona McAllister was returning to her ex-boyfriend.

You had been dating Fiona for about five months. She's smart, glamorous, and always seeking something new but has expensive tastes. You felt she was disappointed with your modest lifestyle. To please her, you worked extra hours hoping for a promotion. Then you found out that during one of your late nights at the office, she spent time with her ex, Rick Martin.

Since then, Fiona has been avoiding you and spending more time with Rick. Furious, you investigated Rickâ€”a PhD student in Finance. You couldn't find much about his work; he's been at it for two years and seems to be struggling. Yet, he's been giving Fiona expensive gifts. You also heard from a friend that the wife of Rick's professor stayed at his apartment one weekend.

# The Party

Armed with this knowledge, tonight you went to an office party at Rick's department, which both he and Fiona were attending. Unsure of your exact plan, you were determined to make life difficult for Rick. Before you could act, Rick got into trouble on his own: a woman named Pauline showed up, and he dragged her off outside the office building to talk.

Intrigued, you attempted to spy on them but backed off when Rick's office mate, Tim, saw you in the hallway. Frustrated, you returned to the party and had several beers. Later, you heard Rick invite people to his place and then leave with Pauline. Fiona seemed upset and slipped out after them. Losing track of her in the hallway, you ran to Rick's apartment on foot to catch up.

You arrived just after Rick, intending a man-to-man talk. The door was open, but neither Rick nor Fiona were there so you decided to wait in the living room.

# Recent Events

Reflecting on the evening:

    7:00 PM: You were at a bar with a friend, confirming rumors about Rick.
    7:30 PM: Arrived at the party; Fiona rejected you and seemed in a bad mood.
    7:35 PM: Pauline arrived.
    Shortly After: Tried to spy on Rick and Pauline outside the office building but backed off when Tim saw you in the hallway.
    Afterwards: Mingled at the party, talked with Louis Cagliostro, and had several drinks.
    Around 8:30 PM: Rick left with Pauline; Fiona left right after them.
    8:40 PM: Ran to Rick's apartment (took about 10 minutes).
    At the Apartment: Found the door open but no one inside.
    Soon After: Fiona buzzed up; you let her in. Together, you let in Pauline and then the others.

You all waited in the Rick's saloon for Rick to show up. Shortly after, Harold came back from the bathroom and screamed that Rick's dead body was lying in the hallway.

# The Others

    Fiona McAllister: Your girlfriend, although the relationship is uncertain now.
    Louis Cagliostro: A man you talked to at the party; he didn't seem friendly.
    Harold Chun: Rick's professor; you heard his wife was staying with Rick.
    Margaret Chun: Presumably Harold's wife.
    Tim Kane and Pauline Thompson: Unfamiliar to you before tonight.

# Advice for playing your role
