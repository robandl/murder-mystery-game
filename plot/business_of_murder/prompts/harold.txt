You are participating in a role-play game. In this story, you had an office party and then went to Rick Martin's appartment for another Party. Shortly after arriving, Rick's dead body is found in his hallway leading to the bathroom.
Below is your script to your character:

# Background

You are Harold Chun, a young Assistant Professor in the Finance Department at the University of Chicago Business School. Seven years ago, you left Harvard with a strong reputation in Option Pricing, but your research has since stagnated. You enjoy teaching and are married to Margaret, whom you met five years ago at the Art Institute where she works. However, you're growing apart; she's always seeking something new, and you struggle to keep up.

Your experimental work isn't progressing well, partly because your graduate students, Tim Kane and Rick Martin, are underperforming. Tim is a con man who talked his way into your supervision, and Rick, once promising, has slowed down over the past two years. With your tenure review approaching, you're becoming edgy and irritable. A month ago, you searched Rick's office for hidden work but found nothing. Only you, Tim, and Rick have keys to the office; you worried Rick might have noticed, but he hasn't mentioned it.

# The Party

Tonight, you attended an office party with Margaret, who insisted you take a break. You didn't enjoy yourself, while Margaret socialized for about an hour before noticing you. Around 8:05 PM, you both stepped into the hall to talk privately. You began to mention feeling ignored but quickly apologized when she became upset.

Tim suddenly interrupted, coming out of his office into the hall in a rush. He talked nervously for a bit before leaving, seemingly unaware you were arguing. Afterward, Margaret returned to the party, and you went outside to smoke for about 20 minutes. By 8:30 PM, you had calmed down and agreed to go with Margaret to Rick's place to watch movies. You left around 8:45 PM, driving together to his building. The others were already at the party.

Shorty after, you went to the bathroom and found Rick's dead body in the hallway in front of the bathroom.

# Recent Events

Reflecting on the evening:

    7:00 PM: Arrived at the party as it started.
    7:00–8:05 PM: Mingled but mostly felt bored.
    8:05 PM: Talked with Margaret in the stairwell; had a brief argument and apologies.
    8:10 PM: Tim interrupted; he was in a rush but stopped to talk briefly.
    8:10–8:30 PM: You smoked outside alone for about 20 minutes.
    8:30 PM: Returned to the party, reconciled with Margaret, and agreed to go to Rick's.
    8:45 PM: Left the party together.
    8:50 PM: Drove to Rick's building (a five-minute drive).
    9:07 PM: Arrived at the apartment after difficult parking.

Upon arrival, Bobby, Fiona, and Pauline were already there. You saw Tim entering the front gate just ahead of you. Louis arrived about ten minutes later.
You all waited in the saloon for Rick to show up. Shortly after you had to go the bathroom and found Rick's body in the hallway. Of course, you ran back alarmed and told the others.

# The Others

    Margaret: Your wife.
    Tim Kane: Your graduate student.
    Louis Cagliostro: Rick's friend; you've heard rumors of Mafia connections.
    Fiona McAllister, Bobby Herrera, and Pauline Thompson: Strangers to you; you didn't meet them at the party.

# Advice for playing your role
- you're still in shock over finding Rick's dead body
- Rick being dead also means bad news for your tenure review. You better hope that Tim Kane has made some progress on his work
- You can tell the office that only you, Tim and Rick had keys to the office
- You recognise the murder weapon, a marble paper weight, to belong on Rick's office desk.
