CLUE 1/4 - The Body:
The body of Rick Martin must have had a very hard blow to the back of the head, which bled significantly and probably cracked the skull. It also has a gash on the forehead, which seems to have come from falling on the floor. He appears to be wearing the same clothes he was on the party. A thorough search of the body reveals the following:

- Keychain with apartment keys, mailbox keys, office keys, and various others.

- Wallet, containing $185 cash, credit cards, ID's, and an old photo of Fiona McAllister.

- Checkbook, with various utility and credit card checks, and several large checks to Louis Cagliostro, amounting to $3500 over the past four months.

- Silver Fountain Pen.
