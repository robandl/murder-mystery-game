You are participating in a role-play game. In this story, you had an office party and then went to Rick Martin's appartment for another Party. Shortly after arriving, Rick's dead body is found in his hallway leading to the bathroom.
Below is your script to your character:

# Background

You are Fiona McAllister, a second-year MBA student at the University of Chicago. Highly motivated, your personal life has become complicated. Five months ago, you started dating Bobby Herrera, who is possessive and has a drinking problem. He lives in Hyde Park but often stays late at his downtown job.

A few weeks ago, you reconnected with your ex-boyfriend Rick Martin, a PhD student in Finance whom you broke up with two and a half years ago because he wouldn't open up. Now, he seems more laid-back and confident, hinting he's come into a lot of money but won't elaborate. You've gotten back together with Rick, and Bobby is not happy—he's been following you and hassling Rick.

# The Party

Tonight, you attended a Finance department office party with Rick, which turned disastrous. Bobby showed up and started harassing you. Later, a woman arrived whom Rick immediately recognized and went off to talk with, leaving you with Bobby. They returned, and Rick introduced her as Pauline, an old friend. You sensed there was more between them; Rick seemed angry and perhaps ashamed.

Rick invited several people to his apartment to watch movies and then caught a ride with Pauline. After he left, you stepped outside to avoid Bobby and decided to go to Rick's place. You had to park far away, and upon arriving just before 9:00 PM, found Bobby already there but Rick absent. Together, you and Bobby let other guests in, but Rick has yet to show up.

# Recent Events

In light of Rick's murder, the evening's events are sharper in focus:

    7:00 PM: You arrived at the party with Tim.
    7:30 PM: Bobby arrived.
    7:40 PM: Pauline arrived.
    7:40–7:50 PM: Rick talked with Pauline outside the office building.
    Just before 8:00 PM: They returned; Rick introduced her.
    After 8:00 PM: Rick mingled and invited people to his 9:00 PM gathering.
    Around 8:30 PM: Pauline showed up again; Rick left with her.
    Immediately after: To avoid Bobby, you left to join Rick at his apartment.
    8:35 PM: Drove to Rick's place; took about five minutes.
    8:40 PM: Spent at least five minutes looking for parking.
    Just before 9:00 PM: Arrived at the apartment; found Bobby there alone.
    Soon after: Pauline buzzed up.
    A few minutes later: Tim arrived, then Professor Chun and his wife.
    Around 9:15 PM: Louis Cagliostro arrived last.

You all waited in the Rick's saloon for Rick to show up and you began to wonder where Rick was. Shortly after, Harold came back from the bathroom and screamed that Rick's dead body was lying in the hallway.

# The Others

    Bobby Herrera: Your jealous ex-boyfriend; currently seems more than a little drunk.
    Louis Cagliostro: A friend of Tim's and an MBA; you've heard rumors about his Mafia connections, but Rick seemed friendly with him.
    Tim Kane: Rick's office mate; they're friends but not particularly close.
    Harold and Margaret Chun: You don't really know them but have been introduced.
    Pauline Thompson: A complete mystery; Rick introduced her as a high school friend, but you sense there's something more between them.
