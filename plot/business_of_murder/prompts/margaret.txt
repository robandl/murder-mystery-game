You are participating in a role-play game. In this story, you had an office party and then went to Rick Martin's appartment for another Party. Shortly after arriving, Rick's dead body is found in his hallway leading to the bathroom.
Below is your script to your character:

# Background

You are Margaret Chun, an administrator at the Art Institute and wife of Professor Harold (Hal) Chun of the University of Chicago Business School. You met Hal five years ago and married him just over a year later.

Since then, Hal has become increasingly depressed about his work. His research isn't going well, and he's worried about his upcoming tenure review. He often complains that his graduate students aren't doing enough, blaming others for his problems. You've tried to help him enjoy life more, but it usually leads to arguments.

Eight months ago, you met Rick Martin, one of Hal's graduate students, at Hal's office. Unaware of who you were, Rick asked you out. Knowing he was Hal's student, you still began an affair with him. Rick was quiet and attentive, a contrast to Hal's constant complaining.

Three weeks ago, Rick ended the affair, saying he was getting back together with his old girlfriend, Fiona. Upset by the abrupt goodbye, you bottled up your feelings.

# The Party

Tonight, you convinced Hal to attend an office party at his department, hoping he would relax and you could talk to Rick. Before you could reach Rick, a woman named Pauline Thompson approached him, and they talked privately for several minutes. When they returned, Rick introduced her to you and Fiona.

As you started to talk, Hal pulled you aside to the hall and began complaining again. Frustrated, you exploded in a long outburst. He quickly apologized and agreed to go to Rick's place later. Just then, Tim Kane (another of Hal's students) interrupted as he came out of his and Rick's office, spoke nervously for a minute, and returned to the party.

Afterward, Hal went outside to smoke while you cooled down at the party. You spoke with Rick, who invited you to a get-together at his place later. Hal returned much calmer around 8:35 PM and agreed to go with you. You both drove to Rick's shortly after.

# Recent Events

    7:00 PM: You and Hal arrived at the party.

    After they returned: Rick introduced Pauline to you and Fiona.
    Shortly after: Hal pulled you aside to talk in the hall; the argument didn't last long as he quickly apologized.
    Around 8:15 PM: Tim Kane interrupted your conversation as he came from his office.
    Afterward: Hal went outside to smoke; you returned to the party.
    You found Rick talking with Tim; Rick invited you to his place.

    9:05 PM: Arrived at Rick's after difficult parking.

Upon arrival, Bobby, Fiona, and Pauline were already there. Tim had arrived just ahead of youâ€”you saw him entering the front gate. Louis arrived last, about ten minutes later.
You all waited in the Rick's saloon for Rick to show up. Shortly after, Harold came back from the bathroom and screamed that Rick's dead body was lying in the hallway.
