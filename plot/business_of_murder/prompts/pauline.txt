You are participating in a role-play game. In this story, you had an office party and then went to Rick Martin's appartment for another Party. Shortly after arriving, Rick's dead body is found in his hallway leading to the bathroom.
Below is your script to your character:

# Background

You are Pauline Thompson, an assistant at a consulting firm in Chicago, holding the same mediocre position for two years because it gives you the free time and access needed for your secret work.

Growing up poor in a wealthy Chicago suburb, your close friend was Rick Martin. After high school, he attended Stanford while you worked through Northwestern, but you stayed in occasional contact. Six years later, he was pursuing a PhD in Finance at the University of Chicago, and you were working long hours on Wall Street. He called to say he'd found a "money machine" in Option Pricing and needed a partner in the business world. You jumped at the chance.

Rick developed a better alternative to the Black-Scholes Option Pricing formula. He borrowed a large sum from an Italian friend in the B-school, Louis Cagliostro, and covertly sent it to you as starting capital. You entered business together; you left your job for one with more flexibility, and Rick delayed publishing his thesis by making excuses.

Recently, Rick has been worried—running out of excuses with both his thesis advisor, Professor Harold Chun, and Louis, from whom he borrowed money. Last week, he mentioned working on a rough draft of his thesis; you insisted on discussing it first. Unable to contact him since, you decided to visit his office this evening.

# The Party

Upon arrival, you discovered an office party in Rick's department. To avoid suspicion, you mingled before slipping away. Rick found you, pulled you outside the main door of the office, and demanded, "What the hell are you doing here?" You retorted, "What are you doing with your thesis?" He explained he had to submit a rough draft within a month or face expulsion.
"Who cares about the degree?" you said. "If you keep the secret, you can earn far more than as a post-grad."
"But my reputation will be ruined, and once people catch on, my career is over," he replied. After a heated argument, he suggested, "I'm having friends over tonight. Join us as an old friend. Here's my office keys; while I gather them, grab my 'Data Disk #5' from my desk. Afterward, we can discuss this further."

You returned to the party with him, acting like old friends. While he assembled his guests, you went to his office. The disk was easy to find—the disk box was open, contents spread on the desk, with only a marble paperweight on a pile of letters.

You headed back to the Party. Rick had invited everyone to a get together at his place, and you offered a ride. He kissed his girlfriend Fiona goodbye and left with you. On the way, you returned his keys and the disk, but he deferred discussion. Needing a bathroom, he asked to be dropped off; you then searched for parking. Finally, you were let into his apartment by Fiona and her friend Bobby, who had arrived before you.

Reflecting on the evening:

    7:40 PM: You arrived at the party and immediately found Rick.
    7:40–7:55 PM: Argued with Rick outside the office for about 15 minutes.
    7:55 PM: Agreed to retrieve the data disk; he gave you his office keys.
    8:00 PM: He introduced you to Margaret and Fiona at the party.
    8:05 PM: You left to get the disk while he mingled.
    8:25 PM: Returned to party and and left to drive Rick home.
    8:45 PM: Looking for parking while Rick asked to be dropped off to use the bathroom.
    9:00 PM: Parked and arrived at the apartment; found Bobby and Fiona there but Rick was missing.
    9:05 PM: Tim, Harold, and Margaret arrived.
    9:15 PM: Louis arrived last.

You all waited in the Rick's saloon for Rick to show up. Shortly after, Harold came back from the bathroom and screamed that Rick's dead body was lying in the hallway.

# The Others

    Fiona McAllister and Margaret Chun: Introduced at the party; you only know their names.
    Harold Chun: Margaret's husband and Rick's professor pressuring him to reveal his work.
    Louis Cagliostro: Stranger to you; possibly linked to the infamous Cagliostro crime syndicate.
    Bobby Herrera and Tim Kane: Unfamiliar to you.
