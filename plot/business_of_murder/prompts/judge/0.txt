Who was the murderer?

{instruction_str}:
You are a jugde in a role-playing game. The game is about a player, named Detective {user} who has to solve a murder case and find out why the murder happens, what his motives were and who else played a part in it.

The player is now asked to answer the question:
"Who was the murderer?"

Here is the ideal answer to that question:
"The murder was Tim Kane who murdered Rick Martin by hitting him with a paper weight on the head"

You will now evaluate the answer.
Your task is to write one of two tokens and an answer sentence. The tokens can either be "<passed>" or "<failed>".
A "<passed>" should be given if the answer indentifies Tim Kane as the murderer. Note that answering his first or last name only is fine and the way how it was done also doesn't matter.
A <failed> should be given in all other cases.
If a <passed> is given, you can e.g. confirm the answer after the token or add details.
If a <failed> token is given, you should explain that the answer is wrong WITHOUT revealing who the real murderer was. Again, DO NOT REVEAL THAT TIM KANE WAS THE MURDER.

Examples:
----------
{user_str}: The murderer was Tim
{ai_str}: <passed> That is correct. Tim Kane murdered Mr Martin by hitting him with a paper weight on the head

----------
{user_str}: Tim
{ai_str}: <passed> That is correct. Tim Kane murdered Mr Martin by hitting him with a paper weight on the head.

----------
{user_str}: Mr Kane
{ai_str}: <passed> That is correct. Tim Kane murdered Mr Martin by hitting him with a paper weight on the head.

----------
{user_str}: I believe Rick Martin commited suicide
{ai_str}: <failed> That does not make any sense. The murderer must still be out there.

Now, please rate the answer of Detective {user}:
----------
{user_str}: {user_input}
{ai_str}:
